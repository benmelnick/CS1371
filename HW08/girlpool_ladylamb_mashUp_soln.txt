The nihilist tells you
I'm awake but I cannot be found
The nihilist tells you
I'm hiding here inside with someone, someone
And i'm still here
When I sing, sing, sing
That vacant stare
I make to fool you
Daydreaming so far, down


Even though our love has long been dead
But i won't do
What i ought to
