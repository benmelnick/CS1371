1. I chose the grade calculator website project. I chose this project because Iâ€™ve always been interested in how web pages are programmed, and I wanted to challenge myself by learning a new language entirely.

2. I chose to provide two different options for my project: one that allows the user to calculate the grade he/she needs to get on the final to get a certain grade, and another that allows the user to calculate their final grade if they know what they actually got on the final. I chose to do this to strengthen my project by adding a totally new element to it. To accomplish this, I decided to use the JQuery library of JavaScript. I did this because JQuery more closely resembles Java, which I have had a lot of experience with. Using JQuery made it much easier for me to learn how to program a web page in HTML and JavaScript.

3. In completing this project, I learned two entirely new languages that will certainly become useful to me. More importantly, however, I gained valuable experience in utilizing research to strength my skills as a programmer. I had to start from scratch and teach myself these languages to make my project, so this experience makes me feel confident in my ability to learn new languages and build more complex programs.
